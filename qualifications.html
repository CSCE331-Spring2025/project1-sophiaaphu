          If you’re reading this, welcome to my webpage! I’m Sophia, and I am
          from Houston Texas. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer
          Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics at Texas A&M University.
        </p>
        <p class="rect_text">
          I am interested in full stack/software development and artificial
          intelligence. I am a passionate software engineer that enjoys creating
          projects that are aesthetic and user centered
        </p>
        <p class="rect_text">
          In my free time, I enjoy creating beautiful music and art, and I am a
          violinist in the TAMU Chamber Orchestra. I have played piano since I
          was 5 and violin since I was 9. Music is something that allows me to
          relieve my stress, make wonderful friendships, and collaborate with a
          team. In addition, I play a decent amount of Pokemon go (I’m always
          down to raid for legendary pokemon) and enjoy watching tiktoks (I’m
          probably on tiktok a little too much lol).
        </p>
        <p class="rect_text">
          I am open to internships and co ops for summer 2025. Feel free to
          contact me at my linkedln or email me at sophiatiffphu@gmail.com.
