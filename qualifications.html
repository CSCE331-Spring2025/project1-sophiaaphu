                    If you’re reading this, welcome to my webpage! I’m Sophia, and I am from Houston Texas. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics at Texas A&M University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in full stack/software development and artificial intelligence. I am a passionate software engineer that enjoys creating projects that are aesthetic and user centered
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy creating beautiful music and art, and I am a violinist in the TAMU Chamber Orchestra. I have played piano since I was 5 and violin since I was 9. Music is something that allows me to relieve my stress, make wonderful friendships, and collaborate with a team. In addition, I play a decent amount of Pokemon go (I’m always down to raid for legendary pokemon) and enjoy watching tiktoks (I’m probably on tiktok a little too much lol). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am open to internships and co ops for summer 2025. Feel free to contact me at my linkedln or email me at sophiatiffphu@gmail.com.
