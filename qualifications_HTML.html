              If you&apos;re reading this, welcome to my webpage! I&apos;m Sophia, and I
              am from Houston Texas. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in
              Computer Engineering and a Minor in Mathematics at Texas A&M
              University.
            </p>
            <p class="rect_text">
              I am interested in full stack/software development and artificial
              intelligence. I am a passionate software engineer that enjoys
              creating projects that are aesthetic and user centered
            </p>
            <p class="rect_text">
              In my free time, I enjoy creating beautiful music and art, and I
              am a violinist in the TAMU Chamber Orchestra. I have played piano
              since I was 5 and violin since I was 9. Music is something that
              allows me to relieve my stress, make wonderful friendships, and
              collaborate with a team. In addition, I play a decent amount of
              Pokemon Go (I&apos;m always down to raid for legendary pokemon) and
              enjoy watching tiktoks (I&apos;m probably on tiktok a little too much
              lol).

              I have ample experiences in full stack web development and mobile
              development. I enjoy the fact that I can wield code to create
              extremely cool products/applications that impact my community.
              There are so many problems that software can solve, and it is fun
              to identify these problems in my community and then create my own
              solution. I also enjoy the aspect of designing the user interface
              of software. I enjoy the creativity in coming up with a design
              that is user friendly, aesthetic, and maintainable. As someone who
              enjoys creating art, I found software development as a form of art
              that I can create.

              I found artificial intelligence interesting because I found it to
              be a very unique way to solve problems. The fact that computers
              can solve problems by someone training it with the right
              techniques and data intrigued me since there is so much potential
              to improve artificial intelligence and the way problems are
              solved. I also found the intersection of artificial intelligence
              and hardware interesting because hardware can be utilized to make
              te training and utilization of AI models quicker and more energy
              efficent.
