          Overall, serving my community has been a significant part of my time
          as an Aggie Engineer. Through service, I am able to help my community

          that they need to succeed.

                I have served as a TA for CSCE 120 since Fall 2024. Overall it
                has been a valuable and enjoyable experience. I enjoy getting to
                teach students vital C++ concepts that set the foundation for
                later C++ classes. I always am happy getting to lead my lab
                section every week (even if it is at 8am this semester) and help
                students with their homework in office hours.

                I also found the opportunity to coordinate course materials a
                insightful experience. I was able to learn how a class is
                managed logistically from setting up assignments, grading exams,
                to even detecting plagiarism and artificial intelligence use.
                Though TAing has been a lot of work, I wouldn&apos;t trade the
                experience for the world and intend on TAing till graduation.

                When I was a new freshman engineer, I was trying to find a
                supportive community that would help aggie engineers through
                their time as ETAMing freshman. I found the Engineering TAO, and
                becoming involved in it was one of the best decisions I made. It
                was one of the most active and supportive communities I joined,
                and I enjoy the opportunity to provide support to ETAMing
                freshman and other engineers in the server.

                I joined up as a web officer in February 2024 and helped TAO
                develop their website. This opportunity helped me hone my web
                development skills and collaborate as a team to create a cool
                product. As president, I have been able to coordinate cool
                opportunities that would improve TAO for its members like
                hosting a Big Tech Intern Panel, a resume review event, creating
                new web applications and internal tools, and continuing to
                foster the wonderful community of TAO.

                As a freshman engineer, I was looking for opportunities to get

                career. I found Aggie Coding Club to be a great place to grow my
                coding skills and work on practical projects alongside other
                students.

                Joining as a projects officer in February 2024 allowed me to
                help coordinate hackathons, mentor new members, and lead
                development efforts for club projects. It has been a rewarding
                experience seeing students grow and develop their skills in
                coding, teamwork, and problem-solving.
